    # Task 1: Grocery Store Math

# Given Prices of Three Items in a Grocery Store
item1_price = 6.2
item2_price = 4.6
item3_price = 2.8

# Calculating the Total Cost
total_cost = item1_price + item2_price + item3_price

# Results
print(f"The total cost of the three items is: ${total_cost}")




    # Task 2: Bank Interest

# Given Values
initial_amount = 2500.0  
yearly_interest_rate = 0.08  

# Calculate the Total Amount After One Year
total_amount_after_one_year = initial_amount * (1 + yearly_interest_rate)

# Print the result
print(f"The total amount in your account after one year is: ${total_amount_after_one_year:.2f}")     #2f Floating Value




    # Task 3: Area and Perimeter

# Given values
length = 8  
width = 5   

# Calculating the Area and Perimeter
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

# Print the Results
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area} square feet")
print(f"The perimeter of the rectangle is: {perimeter} feet")
